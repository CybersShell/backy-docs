Binaries are available from the [release page](https://git.andrewnw.xyz/CyberShell/backy/releases). Make sure to get the correct version for your system, which supports x86_64, ARM64, and i386.

### Source Install

You can install from source. You will need [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then run:

```bash
go install git.andrewnw.xyz/CyberShell/backy@master
```

Once set, jump over to the [config docs](/getting-started/config) and start configuring your file.
