This is the section on the config file.

To use a specific file:
```backy [command] -f /path/to/file```

If you leave the config path blank, the following paths will be searched in order:

- `./backy.yml`
- `./backy.yaml`
- `~/.config/backy.yml`
- `~/.config/backy.yaml`

Create a file at `~/.config/backy.yml`.

See the documentation in this section to configure it.
